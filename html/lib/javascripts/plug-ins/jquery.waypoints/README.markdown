# jQuery Waypoints

Waypoints is a small jQuery plugin that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element.

```js
$('.entry').waypoint(function() {
  alert('You have scrolled to an entry.');
});
```

[Read the full documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#documentation) for more details on usage and customization.

## Examples

Waypoints can be used as a base for several common scroll-based UI patterns. Check out these examples of:

- [Infinite Scrolling](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/infinite-scroll)
- [Sticky Elements](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/sticky-elements)
- [Scroll Analytics](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/scroll-analytics)
- [Dial Controls](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/dial-controls)

## Support

Waypoints has been tested to work with jQuery versions 1.4.3+ in IE6+, FF3+, Safari 4+, Chrome 6+, and Opera 11+.  Other browsers and jQuery versions may work fine, but this is all I've looked at so far.

Unit tests for Waypoints are written with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [jasmine-jquery](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery).  You can [run them here](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/test/). If any of the tests fail, please open an issue and include the browser used, operating system, and description of the failed test.

## Changelog

### v1.1.4

- Add handler option to give alternate binding method.
  
### v1.1.3

- Fix cases where waypoints are added post-load and should be triggered immediately.
	
### v1.1.2

- Fixed error thrown by waypoints with triggerOnce option that were triggered via resize refresh.

### v1.1.1

- Fixed bug in initialization where all offsets were being calculated as if set to 0 initially, causing unwarranted triggers during the subsequent refresh.
- Added `onlyOnScroll`, an option for individual waypoints that disables triggers due to an offset refresh that crosses the current scroll point. (All credit to [@knuton](https://github.com/knuton) on this one.)

### v1.1

- Moved the continuous option out of global settings and into the options
  object for individual waypoints.
- Added the context option, which allows for using waypoints within any
  scrollable element, not just the window.

### v1.0.2

- Moved scroll and resize handler bindings out of load.  Should play nicer with async loaders like Head JS and LABjs.
- Fixed a 1px off error when using certain % offsets.
- Added unit tests.

### v1.0.1

- Added $.waypoints('viewportHeight').
- Fixed iOS bug (using the new viewportHeight method).

## Known Todos
